## Project 1 : TNB Bill Calculation Form (Microsoft Excel VBA)
In this project, I have created a TNB Bill Calculation Form by using ***Microsoft Excel VBA***. This form can help user to calculate electricity bill by just key in the monthly consumption (in kwh) and arrears (in RM, if any) to calculate the total amount of the electricity bill. This form also contains different details like discount, service tax and etc. Image below is a blank form example that contains 'Details Enter Form' for user to key in and 'This is your Electricity Bill' to show total amount and details for the bill. 

You can download the whole project in zip file **'TNB BILL CALCULATION FORM'** that I have uploaded in this repository to view this project, whole explanation and different sample case in *Microsoft Excel*. Thank you .
